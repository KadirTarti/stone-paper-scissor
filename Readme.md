### Project Planning & Management 🗺️

Epic User Story: Developing a To-Do List using JS 


## User Stories:
1. As a user, I want to enter the name of a city in an input field so that I can query its weather information.
2. As a user, I want the weather information to be displayed on cards with icons for easy understanding.3
3. As a user, I want the option to query weather information in both English and German languages for flexibility.
4. As a user, I want the previous search results to remain on the screen without complete refreshing, allowing me to compare different city's weather easily.
5. As a user, I want to be able to remove the previous search result from the screen by clicking on the 'x' button in the upper right corner of the card structure for a clean interface.



## Objective 🔍

Build a Weather App using axios

### At the end of the project, we will be able to;

⭐ improve coding skills within HTML & CSS & JS 

⭐ use git commands (push, pull, commit, add etc.) and Github as Version Control System.
